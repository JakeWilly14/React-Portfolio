        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Charles Williams and I am
        currently enrolled as a Full-Stack development bootcamp student at
        Kansas University. I have always been interested in computer sciences,
        but unfortunately did not have the time or circumstances to persure them
        until now! This application is a demonstration of my current grasp on
        full-stack development and also a hub for all my current projects. Take your time to look at my projects and feel free to contact me
        through the links above!
