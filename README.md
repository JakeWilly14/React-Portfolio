  ## Installation
  This is my personal portfolio so there will be a link at the bottom with my portfolios deployment link!
  
  ## Usage
  Hopefully the user interface is developed well enough to be self explanatory. However you will land on my 'About Me' page where you can read a small paragraph describing myself.  There is a Header with a navigation bar with my name and links to other pages such as my projects, contact, and resume. The footer links have three icons that will navigate you to my peronsal Github, my LinkedIn page, and Stackoverflow page.
  
  ## Contributors
  There are many online resources I used and plan to credit them here.
  
  ## Tests
  No current test for this project.
